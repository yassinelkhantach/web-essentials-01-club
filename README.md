# Welcome to the Club 01 Web Development Training Program!

This repository contains the code and resources for a web project developed as part of the Club 01 training program at ENSAH. The project is designed to showcase the skills and knowledge gained during the program and is built using modern web development technologies.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Bootstrap framework to ensure a clean and modern design. It also utilizes jQuery and AJAX for dynamic content loading and a smooth user experience.

In addition to the website code, the repository also includes documentation on how to set up and deploy the project, as well as a list of resources used during development.

We hope that this project serves as a valuable showcase of the skills and knowledge gained during the Club 01 Web Development Training Program, and we welcome any feedback or contributions to help improve the project further.
